# microservices-antipatterns

When migrating from a monolithic to a microservice-based architecture, one need to know patterns and antipatterns in order not to propagate old practices learned from centralized systems to a new structure where services are independent and distributed. We select 5 known antipatterns in microservices based solutions and propose an algorithm for detecting them automatically. The algorithm is also responsible for generating visual output of how resources are used in the project so the developers can manage how resources are distributed in different files or concentrated in few ones. The solution should avoid common mistakes when deploying microservices-based projects and should help project managers to get an overview of the system as a whole.
